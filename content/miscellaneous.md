<b>
SDF
</b>

I've played with the band SDF for over ten years. We met in a pub when I was doing my A-levels. I was sat with a friend and a magician came to our table. For this magic trick he would need two other people, and the two on the table to the left of us would do. We got talking, they were looking for a band member, and a decade on we're still going.

SDF is a collective - the sound and the people have changed over the years. Members include Adam Parkinson (AKA [Danelaw](https://soundcloud.com/thedanelaw)), Oliver Marchant and Adam White.

LIPSYNC
</b>

Me and my friends Blanche and Hetta have ran Lipsync nights at [Ort cafe](http://ortcafe.co.uk/) for the last couple of years. It's better than Karaoke as you can forget about having to <i>sound</i> good and just concentrate on <i>looking</i> good. Plus it's an excuse to dress up like Dolly Parton and listen to [Jolene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTuQ9cKGSdM) again and again.
