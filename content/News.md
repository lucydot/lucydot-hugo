<b>1st June 2020</b> </br>
Today is my first official day as a Vice-Chancellor's fellow at Northumbria University. I'm on maternity leave until October, but happy to stop thinking about baby Robin for a little while and attend the online induction events. With lots of events moving online it's been easy for me to keep a toe in the academic waters. I welcome being able to stay in touch during maternity leave, as long as it's on my terms :)

<b>12th March 2020</b></br>
Our CarrierCapture.jl software has been accepted for publication with [the Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/). The accompanying paper can be found [here](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02102).

<b>17th March</b></br>
I have been awarded the [Thomas Young Centre](https://www.thomasyoungcentre.org/) at Imperial prize: "An annual award to the student who has demonstrated the most important and innovative contribution to research in the Theory and Simulation of Materials". A special thanks to the Walsh group post-docs who worked with and supported me through my PhD (including [Jarvist Frost](https://jarvist.github.io/), [Jonathan Skelton](https://skelton-group.github.io/), [Sunghyun Kim](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=v438vEAAAAAJ&hl=en), [Ji-Sang Park](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=ZCmm3y8AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Samantha Hood](https://www.samanthahood.com.au/)). I think the prize money should be spent on thousands of Lindt Lindor chocolates.

<b>13th January 2020</b></br>
I have been awarded the degree of Doctor of Philosophy! It's been the most productive four years of my life, and very enjoyable to boot: a huge thanks to my supervisor [Prof. Aron Walsh and his team](http://wmd-group.github.io/) at Imperial College London.

I'm currently on maternity leave until October 2020 - wish me luck! <img src="./images/baby_icon.png" height="30"> 

<b>25th November</b></br>
I'm happy to announce that I will be joining Northumbria University as a Vice-Chancellor's fellow in the department of [Mathematics, Physics and Electrical Engineering](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/academic-departments/mathematics-physics-and-electrical-engineering/research/), and aligned with the [EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Renewable Energy Northeast Universities](https://renu.northumbria.ac.uk/). I'm very excited to see what future research projects and collaborations will bring!

<b>14th November</b></br>
Today I'm teaching version control using Git at Imperial College London. It's fully booked but you can follow the material yourself using the course webpage which is [here](https://kmichali.github.io/2019-11-14-Imperial/) and the slides which are [here](https://lucydot.github.io/slides/1911_git/SWC_git_1911.pdf).

<b>5th October</b></br>
From the 5th October until the 9th of November I will be visiting the [Laboratory for Materials and Structures](https://www.msl.titech.ac.jp/english/member/profile/oba_en.html) at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. We hope to develop software for the high-throughput calculation of non-radiative recombination rates, and builds on the [CarrierCapture software](https://github.com/WMD-group/CarrierCapture.jl) developed by the Walsh group at Imperial. 

<b>1st October 2019</b></br>
From the 5th of October 2019 until the 26th of January 2020 DotSpace will be exhibited at the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum, The Row Gallery and Leamington Spa Art Gallery and Museum as part of the Coventry Biennial.  To accompany the exhibition I am developing a DotSpace web app (aka The Grain Generator) so that visitors can generate their own DotSpace picture - the web app can be found [here](https://boiling-peak-32563.herokuapp.com/voila/render/dotspace.ipynb). More information about the exhibition can be found [here](https://www.theherbert.org/whats_on/1490/coventry_biennial__the_twin).
