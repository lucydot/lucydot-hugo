Before my PhD I worked as a maths teacher in prisons and at a primary school. My favourite maths class was to talk about [what a naughty but clever boy Gauss was](https://magoosh.com/gre/2011/what-a-naughty-boy-can-teach-us-about-adding/).
My current teaching is predominantly at the graduate level via the [Software Carpentry organisation](https://carpentries.org/). If you are looking for someone to deliver a Software Carpentry workshop at your institution and think I may be able to help, please [get in contact](mailto:l.whalley@northumbria.ac.uk).
