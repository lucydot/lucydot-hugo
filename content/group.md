<b>Funded PhD opportunity - closes 7th Feb</b> </big>

Do you want to use your science and/or engineering skills to mitigate climate change? Do you like computers, atoms and electrons?

Applications are open for the funded PhD project "Modelling disorder in Mg-ion battery cathode materials". You will be part of a growing team based at Northumbria University and the new Centre for Doctoral Training in Renewable Energies North-East Universities (CDT-ReNU).

The job advert is [here](https://bit.ly/renu_mg). I especially encourage applications from those who identify as part of a group that is under-represented in physics.

In return for your efforts, you will receive a standard EPSRC stipend, specialist training through the CDT-ReNU and experience working at the forefront of research. The University of Northumbria is based in the beautiful city of Newcastle: we have a beach, Hadrian's wall and excellent nightlife - something for everyone!

If you're interested in applying, please [contact me](mailto:l.whalley@northumbria.ac.uk) for more information.
