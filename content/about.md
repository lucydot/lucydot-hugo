My name is Lucy Whalley ([My CV](../LW_resume.pdf), <img src="../images/email.png" alt="lucy at gmail dot com">): 

<img src="./images/lattice_icon.png" width="30" height="30"> I am a researcher in the [Materials Design Group](http://wmd-group.github.io/) at Imperial College London. [My research](http://lucydot.github.io/research/) uses solid-state physics and supercomputers to investigate why particular materials can efficiently convert sunlight into electrical energy.  

<img src="./images/teaching_icon.png" width="30" height="30"> I am a qualified teacher, and I have taught mathematics in a variety of settings - prisons, primary schools and cafes. I am [currently teaching](http://lucydot.github.io/teaching/) basic programming skills to researchers at Imperial College London.

<img src="./images/coding_icon.png" width="30" height="30"> I am a 2019 fellow of the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://software.ac.uk/about). I am interested in how we can improve research practice in the computational sciences - with a focus on [working openly](https://lucydot.github.io/open/) and [software publishing](https://lucydot.github.io/slides/SSI_0219/).
